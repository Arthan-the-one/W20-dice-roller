# Usage:
Open the html file in a (modern) Browser.

Everything else should be self explanatory for a Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary edition Player - if it is not, feel free to open an issue detailing your complaints.

Probably also usable for other World of Darkness 20th Anniversary edition variants (Vampire, Wraith, ...), but untested
